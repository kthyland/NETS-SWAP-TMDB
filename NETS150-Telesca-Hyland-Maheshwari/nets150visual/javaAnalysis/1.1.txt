[Prologue: Episode begins at Castle Black, the primary redoubt of the Night's Watch. Three rangers, SER WAYMAR ROYCE, GARED, and WILL, are preparing to embark on a ranging. They enter the tunnel leading to beyond the Wall, eventually emerging on the other side, where they continue on into the Haunted Forest, all of them branching off in different directions. We follow WILL, who has arrived at a clearing in the forest, His horse nickers nervously.]</i>
WILL: Easy, boy....
[He climbs off his horse to go scout the clearing on foot. He slowly approaches what appears to be a small camp, crawling through the snow to better conceal himself. He finally reaches the camp, only to find that it has been completely ransacked, with the brutally mutilated corpses of multiple wildlings scattered all around the area. WILL is clearly terrified at what he sees and runs off, only to appear in front of the body of a wildling child skewered on a tree branch. WILL immediately runs off, getting back on his horse and fleeing the scene. As he leaves, we see the wildling corpses are arranged in a diamond-like pattern.]</i>
[WILL has reunited with WAYMAR and GARED. WAYMAR is messing with the saddle on his horse, not looking at either GARED or WILL.]</i>
WAYMAR: What d’you expect? They’re savages. One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it, they’re ripping each other to pieces.
WILL: I’ve never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I’ve never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life!
WAYMAR: How close did you get?
WILL: Close as any man would.
GARED: We should head back to the Wall.
[WAYMAR turns to face GARED.]</i>
WAYMAR: <i>[condescending]</i> Do the dead frighten you?
GARED: Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They won’t trouble us no more.
WAYMAR: You don’t think he’ll ask us <i>how</i> they died? Get back on your horse.
[GARED huffs, clearly not pleased with WAYMAR giving him orders. He grumbles under his breath as he walks off.]</i>
WILL: Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children!
WAYMAR: It’s a good thing we’re not children. You want to run away South, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter … <i>if</i> I don’t catch you first.
[WILL stares at WAYMAR, still looking nervous.]</i>
WAYMAR: <i>[firmly]</i> Get back on your horse. I won’t say it again.
[WILL is hesitant, but finally relents, getting back on his horse.]</i>
[The three of them are seen approaching the area with the corpses on foot, their swords drawn. When they get there, all of the corpses have vanished. WAYMAR enters the camp and looks around.]</i>
WAYMAR: <i>[with a hint of annoyance]</i> Your dead men seem to have moved camp.
WILL: They were here....
[GARED looks wary.]</i>
GARED: <i>[to WILL]</i> See where they went.
[WILL starts to backtrack, while WAYMAR continues, GARED behind him.]</i>
[WAYMAR and GARED have entered another clearing not far from the abandoned camp. GARED has spotted something in the snow and bends over to pick it up; it is some kind of torn-up red cloth.]</i>
WAYMAR: What is it?
GARED: It’s -
[Before GARED can tell him, a mysterious CREATURE appears behind WAYMAR. GARED looks horrified. WAYMAR notices GARED's look and immediately turns around; we briefly see that the creature is a WHITE WALKER. As he turns, the WHITE WALKER slashes at him, presumably killing him.]</i>
[Elsewhere in the forest, WILL is wandering alone when he hears GARED screaming in the distance. All three of the horses are seen galloping away, clearly panicked. WILL watches them go with a combined look of confusion and fright. He looks in the direction the horses came from, only to see a small figure standing there. It slowly turns around, revealing itself to be the dead WILDLING GIRL from the abandoned camp. It has been reanimated as a WIGHT and has blue eyes. WILL, horrified, begins running away as fast as he can through the forest. We then see that GARED is also running away, being pursued by the WHITE WALKER. Both WILL and GARED stop in another clearing to catch a breath. They both look up and realize they are in the same clearing. However, at that very moment, the WHITE WALKER grabs GARED by the back of his neck and slices his head off. A terrified WILL then falls to his knees. The WHITE WALKER chatters and growls at him in a strange language before throwing GARED's severed head at WILL's feet. WILL continues to stare at the WHITE WALKER with a defeated look on his face.]</i>
/ BLACKOUT /<br>/ OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE /
[Episode opens up on the outskirts of Winterfell, the stronghold of House Stark, the Great House of the North. A group of Stark riders are seen chasing after someone, who is revealed to be WILL. WILL doesn't get very far before he's surrounded by riders, two of whom point spears at him. One rider, SER KORMED GRAYBURN, gets off his horse and steps in front of WILL.]</i>
KORMED: You're a long way from Castle Black, ranger.
[A rider is next shown returning to Winterfell. In Winterfell's main courtyard, we see 10-year old BRAN STARK practicing archery. With him are his brothers, 17-year old ROBB STARK, 17-year old ASHTER STARK, and 15-year old RODRIK STARK, as well as his bastard half-brother, 17-year old JON SNOW. BRAN fires an arrow, but it misses the target, instead hitting a barrel. BRAN stomps his foot in frustration. JON goes over to put his arm around BRAN's shoulders.]</i>
JON: Go on. Father’s watching. And your mother.
[They both glance up at an upper walkway, where their father, LORD EDDARD "NED" STARK, and his wife, LADY CATELYN STARK, are indeed watching. NED gives BRAN an encouraging nod when they make eye contact. BRAN nods back, then prepares to fire another arrow.]</i>
[Scene shifts to inside Winterfell's main keep, where SEPTA MORDANE, the primary governess of Winterfell, is giving a sewing lesson to the girls of the castle. Among them are NED and CATELYN's only daughters, 13-year old SANSA STARK and 11-year old ARYA STARK. MORDANE is inspecting SANSA's stitching.]</i>
SEPTA MORDANE: Fine work as always. Well done!
SANSA: Thank you.
SEPTA MORDANE: I love the detail that you’ve managed to get in this corners. Quite beautiful! The stitching....
[As SEPTA MORDANE continues to praise SANSA's needlework, ARYA glances at them, less than thrilled about the praise SANSA was receiving. She resumes sewing, but stops when she overhears the archery practice outside.]</i>
[Back in the courtyard, BRAN is still practicing, with his brothers and parents still watching him. He fires another arrow, but misses the target completely. ROBB and RODRIK are seen suppressing grins, while JON, ASHTER, and six-year old RICKON - NED and CATELYN's youngest son - who is watching from nearby, all chuckle.]</i>
NED: And which one of <i>you</i> was a marksman at ten?
RODRIK: <i>[jokingly]</i> I'm fairly certain I was!
ASHTER: Not on your life, Rodrik...but everyone here knows that <i>I</i> was.
[All of them chuckle. NED does as well.]</i>
NED: Keep practicing, Bran. Go on.
JON: Don’t think too much, Bran.
[BRAN raises his bow again and takes aim at the target.]</i>
ROBB: Relax your bow arm.
[BRAN pulls the arrow back and prepares to fire. An arrow is shown hitting the direct center of the target, but we see that BRAN wasn't the one who fired it. He looks back, only to see ARYA holding a bow, a bemused look on her face; it is evident that she was the one who fired the arrow. The others look back and notice ARYA, who curtseys. BRAN starts chasing after ARYA.]</i>
JON: Quick, Bran! faster!
[RODRIK goes chasing after them too. JON, ROBB, and ASHTER all watch, laughing. Both NED and CATELYN watch from the balcony, looking amused.]</i>
RODRIK CASSEL: <i>[offscreen]</i> Lord Stark!
[Both NED and CATELYN turn around. SER RODRIK CASSEL, the master-at-arms of Winterfell, and THEON GREYJOY, the only surviving son of BALON GREYJOY and NED's ward, are approaching them.]</i>
SER RODRIK: <i>[to CATELYN]</i> My lady.
[CATELYN nods to him.]</i>
SER RODRIK: A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They've captured a deserter from the Night's Watch.
[NED looks away, uncomfortable. After a second, he looks back up again.]</i>
NED: <i>[to THEON]</i> Get the lads to saddle their horses.
[THEON nods and leaves.]</i>
CATELYN: <i>[imploringly]</i> Do you <i>have</i> to?
NED: He swore an oath, Cat.
SER RODRIK: The law is law, my lady.
[CATELYN looks away. She is clearly not pleased.]</i>
NED: Tell Bran he’s coming, too.
[CATELYN looks back at NED, surprised. SER RODRIK nods and departs.]</i>
CATELYN: Ned, ten is too young to see such things.
NED: He won’t be a boy forever. And winter is coming.
[NED departs. CATELYN watches him go, still clearly not pleased. In the courtyard, ROBB, JON, ASHTER, and RICKON are picking up the arrows that were used in archery practice and are putting them away. As JON is putting away the arrows he glances up at CATELYN on the balcony. She gives JON a look of strong dislike. ASHTER notices this, glances at JON, then back at his mother, with a mixture of sadness and anger.]</i>
[Scene shifts to an area not far from Winterfell, acting as an execution area. NED, SER RODRIK, THEON, ROBB, JON, ASHTER, RODRIK and BRAN are all present, as are several Stark soldiers, including JORY CASSEL, SER RODRIK'S nephew and the captain of the guards. KORMED GRAYBURN enters from nearby and approaches NED.]</i>
KORMED: Greetings, Lord Stark. They're bringing the deserter in now.
[NED nods grimly. KORMED goes over to stand next to JORY. A pair of Stark guards bring WILL towards the center of the area.]</i>
WILL: <i>[under his breath]</i> White Walkers....White Walkers....I saw the White Walkers....the White Walkers....the White Walkers....I saw them....
[WILL is finally brought before NED.]</i>
WILL: I know I broke my oath. And I know I’m a deserter.
[NED, JON and BRAN all watch as WILL tells his story with expressionless faces.]</i>
WILL: I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them, but....I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know.
[NED exchanges looks with SER RODRIK, KORMED, and JORY.]</i>
WILL: If you can get word to my family....tell them I’m no coward. Tell them I’m sorry.
[NED is clearly not comfortable with what he has to do, but nods to the guards next to WILL. They put him down head first on the execution block. NED then goes over to THEON and retrieves Ice, House Stark's ancestral greatsword, from its scabbard. He then goes over to the block and bows his head over the sword.]</i>
NED: In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name -
JON: <i>[quietly, to BRAN]</i> Don’t look away.
NED: - King of the Andals and the First Men -
JON: Father will know if you do.
NED: - Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.
[NED swings Ice and beheads WILL. BRAN winces, but he does not look away.]</i>
JON: You did well.
[He walks away. ROBB turns and puts his arm around BRAN, ASHTER does as well, and they go to their horses together. NED hands Ice to a guard before going over to BRAN, who is readying his saddle.]</i>
NED: You understand why I did it?
BRAN: Jon said he was a deserter.
NED: But do you understand <i>why</i> I had to kill him?
BRAN: "Our way is the old way?"
NED: The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
BRAN: Is it true he saw the White Walkers?
[Brief pause as NED considers this.]</i>
NED: The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.
BRAN: So he was lying?
[Another pause as NED and BRAN regard each other. NED clearly looks uneasy.]</i>
NED: A madman sees what he sees.
[NED leaves. BRAN resumes preparing his saddle, but he also now looks uneasy.]</i>
[The Starks and their guards are shown returning to Winterfell. As they are passing through the Wolfswood, they come across a dead stag in the middle of the road. The stag's side and belly have been ripped open, its entrails torn out, and part of one of its antlers has been ripped off. NED gets off his horse to inspect it. JON, THEON, and ASHTER follow him.]</i>
JON: What is it?
THEON: Mountain lion?
NED: There are no mountain lions in these woods.
ASHTER: You sure about that, Father? I mean, the thing's been totally torn apart. What else could it have been?
[NED has a look on his face indicating that he is thinking the same thing. He warily pulls his sword out and goes off to search the area. The others follow him. They continue on for a bit until they discover the corpse of a dead direwolf, the remaining part of the stag's antler through its throat. Crowding around the corpse are several direwolf pups. NED kneels down to look over the direwolf corpse, as does JON. Several of the others, including ROBB, RODRIK, and JORY, all look somewhat unnerved.]</i>
THEON: It’s a <i>freak</i>...
ASHTER: <i>[sarcastic]</i> Well, then, the two of you will get along just fine, then.
[THEON glares at ASHTER. NED glances warningly at ASHTER, subtly telling him that now was not the time. He resumes looking over the corpse.]</i>
NED: It’s a direwolf.
[NED and SER RODRIK glance at each other.]</i>
NED: Tough old beast.
[He yanks out the part of the antler. ROBB still looks somewhat unnerved.]</i>
ROBB: There are no direwolves south of the Wall...
JON: Now there are six.
[RODRIK goes over to kneel beside JON.]</i>
RODRIK: Actually, there's seven.
[JON does a quick head count.]</i>
JON: You're right, Rodrik. Seven.
[JON stands up, picking up one of the pups.]</i>
JON: <i>[to BRAN]</i> You want to hold it?
[BRAN takes the pup.]</i>
BRAN: <i>[concerned]</i> Where will they go? Their mother’s dead.
SER RODRIK: They don’t belong down here.
[NED stands up.]</i>
NED: Better a quick death. They won’t last without their mother.
THEON: Right.
[THEON goes over to take the pup BRAN is holding.]</i>
THEON: Give it here.
[He takes the pup and pulls out a knife.]</i>
BRAN: NO!
ROBB: Put away your blade!
THEON: I take orders from your father, not you.
[ASHTER gets up in THEON's face.]</i>
ASHTER: <i>[threateningly]</i> Do what he says, Greyjoy.
THEON: Are you threatening me?
NED: <i>[to ASHTER and THEON]</i> Both of you, stop!
[ASHTER backs off. THEON is still holding the direwolf pup and his knife. JON is stil staring intently at the other pups.]</i>
BRAN: <i>[imploringly]</i> Please, Father!
RODRIK: Really, Father, it seems a bit harsh to kill them.
[BRAN glances at RODRIK hopefully, then back at his father.]</i>
NED: <i>[sadly]</i> I’m sorry, Bran.
JON: Lord Stark?
[NED glances at JON.]</i>
JON: There are seven pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.
[NED looks away, thinking on this. Everyone looks at him, awaiting his judgment. After a moment, he looks around at all of them, and sighs.]</i>
NED: You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.
[THEON puts away his knife, and BRAN smiles. ROBB and RODRIK both start picking up the other pups.]</i>
BRAN: <i>[to JON]</i> What about you?
JON: I'm not a Stark. Get on.
[BRAN starts to leave. ASHTER walks up to JON, holding what looks like the smallest pup. Unlike the other pups, it is completely white.]</i>
ASHTER: Actually, Jon, you can have this one. He's as white as a snow bear's arse. And he's got red eyes!
[JON looks surprised. ROBB, THEON, and RODRIK all glance back.]</i>
JON: What about you, Ashter?
ASHTER: To be honest, I'd rather not have one. You never know if the bloody dog will rip your throat out in your sleep.
[THEON chuckles.]</i>
THEON: Snow getting the runt of the litter? I suppose that's fitting....
[ASHTER glares at THEON. THEON maintains a smug grin before walking off. ASHTER then turns back to JON.]</i>
ASHTER: He's all yours, brother.
[He hands JON the small white direwolf. JON glances from ASHTER to both ROBB and RODRIK, who both smile. The four of them all leave the area together.]</i>
[Scene shifts to King's Landing, the&nbsp;capital city&nbsp;of the Seven Kingdoms. Bells are heard tolling, signifying that someone has died. In the Red Keep, the primary seat of the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, we see a group of Silent Sisters - priestesses who prepare dead bodies for funeral rites - tending to a body, which is situated in front of the Iron Throne. Upon closer inspection, we see that the body is that of LORD JON ARRYN, the Hand of the King. Observing the Silent Sisters from the gallery of the throne room is QUEEN CERSEI LANNISTER, the wife of KING ROBERT BARATHEON and the Queen Consort of the Seven Kingdoms. Her twin brother, SER JAIME LANNISTER, a knight of the Kingsguard, is seen walking towards her from the conjoining hallway. He then takes place beside her.]</i>
JAIME: As your brother, I feel it’s my duty to warn you - you worry too much. It’s starting to show.
CERSEI: And <i>you</i> never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid.
JAIME: There was nothing to be afraid of until you told Father. <i>[imitating his father]</i> "We’re Lannisters. Lannisters don’t act like fools."
[CERSEI glances back at the body of JON ARRYN.]</i>
CERSEI: <i>[concerned]</i> What if Jon Arryn told someone?
JAIME: But who would he tell?
CERSEI: My husband.
JAIME: If he told the King, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now.
[CERSEI still looks concerned.]</i>
JAIME: Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn’t know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he’s off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around?
[CERSEI is clearly amused by this statement.]</i>
JAIME: And life will go on.
CERSEI: <i>You</i> should be the Hand of the King.
JAIME: That’s an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short.
[Scene shifts back to Winterfell, where we see a raven flying towards the castle. We next see CATELYN walking through the courtyard holding a letter. She is then seen entering Winterfell's godswood, where we see NED polishing Ice by a small pond.]</i>
CATELYN: All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
[NED looks up at her and grins.]</i>
NED: You have seven Northern children. You’re not an outsider.
CATELYN: I wonder if the Old Gods agree....
NED: It’s your Gods with all the rules.
[He looks up at her and grins again, but the grin fades when he sees the look on her face.]</i>
CATELYN: I am so sorry, my love.
NED: Tell me....
CATELYN: There was a raven from King's Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him.
[NED looks away. He is quite shaken by this news.]</i>
CATELYN: I know he was like a father to you.
NED: Your sister, the boy -&nbsp;?
CATELYN: They both have their health. Gods be good.
[Pause. NED still looks saddened by the news. CATELYN sits down next to NED.]</i>
CATELYN: The raven brought more news: the King rides for Winterfell. With the Queen, and all the rest of them.
NED: He’s coming this far North....there’s only one thing he’s after.
CATELYN: You can always say no, Ned.
[NED looks away, deep in thought.]</i>
[Shift to Winterfell's great hall, where the servants are preparing for a great banquet. CATELYN enters with MAESTER LUWIN, the maester of Winterfell, going over preparations for the banquet.]</i>
CATELYN: We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion’s chamber. I’m told he reads all night.
LUWIN: <i>I’m</i> told he <i>drinks</i> all night.
CATELYN: How much could he possibly drink, a man of his...stature?
LUWIN: We’ve brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we’ll find out.
CATELYN: In any case, candles.
[Scene shifts to another area of the castle. ROBB is shirtless and his beard is being shaved by TOMMY, Winterfell's barber. JON, ASHTER, RODRIK, and THEON are all present as well.]</i>
JON: Why’s your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
THEON: It’s for the Queen, I bet. I hear she’s sleek as a mink.
ASHTER: You don't become the Queen without a pretty face.
RODRIK: <i>[to ASHTER]</i> Not necessarily, Ash. But they <i>do</i> say that Cersei Lannister is the most beautiful woman in the Seven Kingdoms.
ASHTER: Let's hope that's not an exaggeration....
[Everyone in the room laughs.]</i>
ROBB: I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
[TOMMY has finished shaving ROBB's face. He is now clean shaven.]</i>
THEON: Think of all those Southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
[ROBB stands up.]</i>
ROBB: <i>[talking about JON]</i> Go on, Tommy, shear him good. He’s never met a girl he likes better than his own hair!
[JON sits down. All the others laugh at this joke, but JON seems to be less than thrilled. TOMMY starts to cut JON's hair.]</i>
[The scene shifts to the outskirts of Winterfell. The royal procession from King's Landing is seen approaching Winterfell. The procession is quite large, numbering at close to a hundred people. BRAN is seen watching from atop one of Winterfell's battlements, clearly in awe of the royal procession. He then begins climbing from the battlement down the conjoining tower. Waiting for him on the ground is his direwolf, SUMMER. At that moment, CATELYN and MAESTER LUWIN walk in from another area.]</i>
CATELYN: <i>[referring to SUMMER]</i> Gods, but they grow fast....
[She glances up and sees BRAN climbing down from the tower.]</i>
CATELYN: Brandon!
BRAN: I saw the King! He’s got hundreds of people!
CATELYN: <i>[sternly]</i> How many times have I told you - <i>no</i> climbing!
BRAN: But he’s coming right now! Down our road!
[BRAN has finally reached the ground. CATELYN walks up to him.]</i>
CATELYN: I want you to promise me - no more climbing.
[BRAN glances down at the ground before looking back at her.]</i>
BRAN: I promise.
CATELYN: D’you know what?
BRAN: What?
CATELYN: You always look at your feet before you lie.
[BRAN chuckles.]</i>
CATELYN: Run and find your father. Tell him the King is close.
[BRAN runs off, followed by SUMMER.]</i>
[The royal procession is shown entering Winterfell. ARYA, who is wearing a helm and a cloak, climbs into an empty carriage to get a good look at them as they enter the outer courtyard. At the front of the procession are several guards bearing the flag of House Lannister, followed by a pair of Kingsguards. Immediately behind them are LORD GARTH DRAGEN, the Lord of Snake Mount and one of House Stark's prominent bannermen, his firstborn son LUCIUS DRAGEN, and his bastard half-brother, SER ETHAN SNOW. Behind them are PRINCE JOFFREY BARATHEON, the first son and heir of ROBERT BARATHEON and CERSEI LANNISTER, who is being followed by his sworn shield, SANDOR "THE HOUND" CLEGANE, who is wearing a helmet in the shape of a snarling dog's head.]</i>
[In the main courtyard of Winterfell, the entire Stark household is assembled, waiting to greet the King and his party. The main family members are shown standing in the front, minus ARYA and ASHTER. JON and THEON are directly behind them with the rest of the household. CATELYN looks around, noticing that neither ARYA or ASHTER are there.]</i>
CATELYN: Where’s Arya? <i>[to SANSA]</i> Sansa, where’s your sister?
[SANSA shrugs. CATELYN looks around again.]</i>
CATELYN: By the Gods, where is Ashter? <i>[to ROBB]</i> Robb?
ROBB: I don't know, Mother.
[RODRIK, who is standing next to ROBB, suppresses a grin. ROBB glances at him with a questioning look on his face, but RODRIK shakes his head. ARYA finally joins the rest of her family in the main courtyard.]</i>
NED: <i>[to ARYA]</i> Hey, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on?
[He pulls off her helm. Both ROBB and JON are amused.]</i>
NED: Have you seen your brother, Ashter?
ARYA: No...
[NED sighs, looking annoyed.]</i>
NED: Go on.
[ARYA goes to stand next to SANSA.]</i>
ARYA: <i>[to BRAN]</i> Move!
[She shoves him out of the way to take her place next to SANSA.]</i>
[The royal procession finally enters the courtyard. We see that the DRAGENS are no longer at the front. JOFFREY, still near the front, glances over at the Starks and makes eye contact with SANSA and grins at her. SANSA grins back. RODRIK notices this and rolls his eyes. At the end of the procession, a carriage is being driven into the courtyard. Finally, KING ROBERT BARATHEON himself enters on horseback. He approaches assembled Stark household, and all of them kneel as he approaches them. ROBERT climbs off his horse and walks up to NED, who is still kneeling. He gestures for him to stand, as as he does, the rest of them stand as well.]</i>
NED: Your Grace.
[He bows his head. There is a pause as NED and ROBERT regard each other.]</i>
ROBERT: You’ve got fat.
[Another pause. NED gives ROBERT a look that clearly says 'Look who's talking.' ROBERT suddenly starts laughing. NED laughs too, and ROBERT proceeds to give him a big hug.]</i>
ROBERT: <i>[to CATELYN]</i> Cat!
CATELYN: Your Grace.
[ROBERT embraces CATELYN as well and pats RICKON on the head.]</i>
ROBERT: <i>[to NED]</i> Nine years. Why haven’t I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
NED: Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.
[CERSEI is seen leaving the carriage along with her other two children, MYRCELLA and TOMMEN BARATHEON. After they get out of the carriage, her cousin, ROBERT LANNISTER, gets out after her and goes off elsewhere. She slowly approaches the Starks.]</i>
ARYA: <i>[to SANSA]</i> Where’s the Imp?
SANSA: Will you shut up?
ROBERT: <i>[to ROBB]</i> Who have we here? You must be Robb.
[He shakes ROBB's hand.]</i>
ROBERT: <i>[to RODRIK]</i> Your name?
RODRIK: Rodrik, Your Grace.
ROBERT: Were you named after the same Rodrik Stark that wrestled the ironborn for Bear Island?
[RODRIK grins.]</i>
RODRIK: The very same.
[ROBERT laughs. Both ROBB and NED are shown grinning.]</i>
ROBERT: <i>[to SANSA]</i> My, you're a pretty one. <i>[to ARYA]</i> Your name is...?
ARYA: Arya.
ROBERT: <i>[to BRAN]</i> Ooh, show us your muscles.
[BRAN does so. ROBERT chuckles.]</i>
ROBERT: You'll be a soldier!
[ROBERT looks around. He appears to be a bit confused.]</i>
ROBERT: Are you missing a child, Ned? You said you had seven, yet I've only met six.
[NED sighs, annoyed.]</i>
NED: My apologies. I don't know where he is.
[ROBERT shrugs. He doesn't seem to mind. Back at the procession, one of the Kingsguards removes his helm, revealing himself to be JAIME.]</i>
ARYA: That’s Jaime Lannister, the Queen’s twin brother!
SANSA: <i>[embarrased]</i> Would you please shut up??
[CERSEI approaches NED and holds out her arm. NED takes her hand and kisses it.]</i>
NED: My Queen.
CATELYN: My Queen.
[CATELYN bows.]</i>
ROBERT: Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
CERSEI: We’ve been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait.
ROBERT: Ned....
[ROBERT heads off towards the crypt. CERSEI looks less than thrilled. NED glances back at her, then follows ROBERT.]</i>
ARYA: <i>[to SANSA]</i> Where’s the Imp?
[CERSEI hears this and wanders over to JAIME.]</i>
CERSEI: Where <i>is</i> our brother? Go find the little beast.
[CATELYN pulls ROBB aside.]</i>
CATELYN: <i>[to ROBB]</i> Robb, go with Rickon to find Ashter. He has to be around here somewhere. Your father won't be pleased that he missed meeting the King.
ROBB: Yes, Mother. <i>[to RICKON]</i> Come on, Rickon.
[ROBB and RICKON depart. RODRIK is once again seen suppressing a grin. CATELYN looks at him shrewdly.]</i>
CATELYN: Is there something you wish to tell me, Rodrik? Do you know where Ashter is?
[RODRIK is still grinning, but looks a bit guilty.]</i>
[Scene changes to ASHTER making love to a naked woman in the godswood. The woman moans as ROBB and RICKON suddenly arrive; ROBB puts his hand over RICKON's eyes and laughs to himself. ASHTER and the woman both look up when they hear him.]</i>
ASHTER: Oh, uh....hi Robb.
ROBB: Really, Ash? <i>This</i> is why you didn't meet the King with us?
ASHTER: Is he here already?
ROBB: <i>[obviously]</i> Yes, he's here already. <i>[brief pause]</i> Does Rodrik know about this?
ASHTER: He, uh...he saw me coming out here with her.
[ROBB still looks amused.]</i>
RICKON: What's going on?
ROBB: I'd suggest you hurry up. Father's not too happy that you missed meeting the King and his party.
[ASHTER shrugs. Both ROBB and RICKON start heading back towards the castle. ROBB finally takes his hand away from RICKON's face.]</i>
RICKON: Why did you cover my eyes? What was he doing?
ROBB: Something important. Come on, we need to get back.
[Back where ASHTER and the woman are. ASHTER begins gathering up his things.]</i>
WOMAN: Do you have to leave? We haven't even finished.
ASHTER: I'm sorry, darling. We'll continue later, I promise.
[She nods and waves at him, blowing him a kiss. ASHTER leaves, looking rather impressed with himself.]</i>
[NED and ROBERT are walking through the Stark family crypt.]</i>
NED: Tell me about Jon Arryn.
ROBERT: One minute he was fine, and then....burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man.
NED: We both did.
ROBERT: He never had to teach <i>you</i> much, but <i>me</i>....you remember me at 16?
[They both chuckle.]</i>
ROBERT: All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what.
NED: Aye.
ROBERT: Don’t look at me like that. It's not his fault I didn’t listen.
[They chuckle again. ROBERT stops walking and turns to face NED.]</i>
ROBERT: I need you, Ned. Down at King's Landing, not up here where you’re no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the King.
[NED, looking overwhemled, kneels.]</i>
NED: I’m not worthy of the honor.
ROBERT: I’m not trying to honor you. I’m trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up.
[NED stands.]</i>
ROBERT: You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing.
[NED still looks overwhelmed.]</i>
ROBERT: We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it’s not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We’ll join our Houses.
ASHTER: <i>[offscreen]</i> Father! Your Grace!
[ASHTER enters the crypts and runs over to NED and ROBERT. He appears to be out of breath. As soon as he reaches them, he stops to catch his breath.]</i>
NED: <i>[annoyed]</i> Ashter, where have you been?
ASHTER: My apologies, Father. I have no excuse.
[ASHTER hastily kneels in front of ROBERT.]</i>
ASHTER: Your Grace. I did not know you were -
ROBERT: Don't worry yourself. And please, stand up.
[ASHTER stands.]</i>
ROBERT: You must be Ashter.
ASHTER: Yes, Your Grace.
ROBERT: So here's the boy I've heard so much about. And you're the spitting image of your uncle Brandon.
[ASHTER grins sheepishly.]</i>
ASHTER: Thank you, Your Grace. I get that a lot.
ROBERT: I've heard that you're an excellent fighter. I'm sure you and I will get along just fine. Tell me, who's older, you or your brother Robb?
ASHTER: Robb.
ROBERT: Seven Hells. I hear the two of you are quite close in age.
ASHTER: Robb and I are only a year apart.
[ROBERT chuckles. ASHTER again looks at him sheepishly.]</i>
NED: <i>[sternly]</i> You were supposed to meet him with us when he first arrived!
ASHTER: I'm sorry, Father, I just -
ROBERT: <i>[consoling]</i> Damn it, Ned, let the poor boy go. I don't give two shits what he was doing. Whatever it was, I'm sure it was better than standing in the damn cold waiting for my fat arse to arrive.
[NED nods. ASHTER grins sheepishly yet again.]</i>
ASHTER: Thank you, Your Grace. <i>[to NED]</i> May I go, Father?
NED: Yes, you may. We'll talk later.
[ASHTER nods and leaves.]</i>
[Scene shifts to a brothel outside of Winterfell. JAIME is seen approaching it. Inside the brothel, TYRION LANNISTER, the younger dwarf brother of JAIME and CERSEI, is drinking a mug of wine. He lets out several moans of pleasure as a red-headed prostitute named ROS comes up after just having finished servicing him. TYRION tosses his mug aside.]</i>
TYRION: It <i>is</i> true what they say about the Northern girls.
[ROS giggles. They both climb into a nearby bed.]</i>
ROS: Did you hear the King’s in Winterfell?
TYRION: I did hear something about that.
[ROS begins removing TYRION's clothes.]</i>
ROS: And the Queen. <i>And</i> her twin brother. They say that <i>he</i> is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
TYRION: And the <i>other</i> brother?
ROS: The Queen has two brothers?
TYRION: There’s the pretty one. And there’s the clever one.
ROS: I hear they call him the Imp.
TYRION: I hear he hates that nickname.
ROS: Oh? <i>I</i> hear he’s more than earned it. <i>I</i> hear he’s a drunken little lecher, prone to <i>all</i> manner of perversions.
TYRION: Clever girl.
ROS: We’ve been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.
TYRION: Have you?
[She climbs on top of TYRION, positioning herself so her breasts are in TYRION's face.]</i>
TYRION: The Gods did give me one blessing...
[JAIME enters without knocking. Both TYRION and ROS look back at him.]</i>
JAIME: Don’t get up.
ROS: My lord...
[She climbs off TYRION.]</i>
TYRION: Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?
JAIME: You’ve much to teach me, no doubt, but our sister craves your attention.
TYRION: She has odd cravings, our sister.
JAIME: A family trait.
[JAIME pours himself a mug of wine.]</i>
JAIME: Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don’t leave me alone with these people.
[JAIME takes a drink.]</i>
TYRION: I’m sorry. I’ve begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses.
JAIME: I thought you might say that. But since we’re short on time....
[He goes over to open the door. Three more whores enter the room.]</i>
JAIME: Come on, girls.
[The whores, giggling, all climb into the bed with TYRION annd ROS.]</i>
JAIME: <i>[to TYRION]</i> See you at sundown.
[JAIME leaves.]</i>
TYRION: Close the door!
[Back in the Winterfell crypt. ROBERT and NED are at the tomb of LYANNA STARK, NED's sister. ROBERT places a feather in the hand of the statue of LYANNA. He appears to be on the brink of tears.]</i>
ROBERT: <i>[somber]</i> Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
NED: She was my sister. This is where she belongs.
ROBERT: She belonged with <i>me</i>.
[He lovingly touches the face of the statue]</i>
ROBERT: <i>[referring to RHAEGAR TARGARYEN]</i> In my dreams, I kill him every night.
NED: It’s done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone.
ROBERT: Not <i>all</i> of them.
[Scene shifts to the home of MAGISTER ILLYRIO MOPATIS, across the Narrow Sea in the Free City of Pentos. DAENERYS TARGARYEN, the daughter of KING AERYS TARGARYEN, is standing on a balcony overlooking the sea.]</i>
VISERYS: <i>[offscreen]</i> Daenerys!
[Her brother, VISERYS TARGARYEN, enters from another area, holding some kind of clothing.]</i>
VISERYS: Daenerys! There’s our bride to be!
[DAENERYS wanders over to him.]</i>
VISERYS: Look – a gift from Illyrio.
[He holds it out; it is a dress.]</i>
VISERYS: Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric.
[DAENERYS does so.]</i>
VISERYS: Mmmm. Isn’t he a gracious host?
DAENERYS: We’ve been his guests for over a year and he’s never asked us for anything.
VISERYS: Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won’t forget my friends when I come into my throne.
[Pause. VISERYS hands the dress to a servant.]</i>
VISERYS: You still slouch. Let them see.
[He starts to undo DAENERYS' gown. This is clearly making her uncomfortable.]</i>
VISERYS: You have a woman’s body now.
[He finally pulls the gown off her. He looks her up and down and strokes her breasts. She is still clearly uncomfortable with it.]</i>
VISERYS: I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me?
[DAENERYS does not reply.]</i>
VISERYS: You don’t want to wake the Dragon, do you?
DAENERYS: No.
[VISERYS nods, a small grin on his face. He starts to leave the chamber, but just before he does, he turns back to his sister.]</i>
VISERYS: When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today.
[He leaves. DAENERYS slowly climbs into her bath, a look of hopelessness on her face.]</i>
SERVANT: It's too hot, my lady!
[DAENERYS ignores her and keeps getting in the bath. The temperature doesn't seem to bother her.]</i>
[Scene shifts to the outside of ILLYRIO's home. VISERYS and DAENERYS are standing with ILLYRIO, awaiting the arrival of the Dothraki warlord KHAL DROGO, whom DAENERYS will be marrying. DAENERYS looks nervous.]</i>
VISERYS: Where is he?
ILLYRIO: The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
[A group of Dothraki, lead by DROGO himself, finally rides up. ILLYRIO walks up to them to greet them.]</i>
ILLYRIO: <i>[in Dothraki]</i> Respect to one that is respectful, Great Khal! <i>[in Common]</i> May I present my honored guests: Viserys of House Targaryen, the Third of His Name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, and his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen.
[ILLYRIO approaches the group and continues speaking to them in Dothraki. VISERYS and DAENERYS stay back.]</i>
VISERYS: Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has <i>never</i> been defeated. He’s a savage, of course, but he’s one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen.
[ILLYRIO turns back to face VISERYS and DAENERYS.]</i>
ILLYRIO: <i>[to DAENERYS]</i> Come forward, my dear.
[DAENERYS slowly and nervously walks towards DROGO, who has not gotten off his horse. She eventually reaches him. They both stare at each other for a long while; DROGO doesn't show any emotion, but DAENERYS has fear on her face. After a while, DROGO turns around and rides off, with the other Dothraki following suit. VISERYS runs down to join DAENERYS and ILLYRIO.]</i>
VISERYS: <i>[confused]</i> Where’s he going?
ILLYRIO: The ceremony is over.
VISERYS: But he didn’t say anything. Did he like her?
ILLYRIO: Trust me, Your Grace - if he didn’t like her, we’d know.
[Shift to a courtyard, where ILLYRIO and VISERYS are standing at an overlook. DAENERYS is standing behind them.]</i>
ILLYRIO: It won’t be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father’s throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.
[VISERYS leaves the balcony and starts walking. DAENERYS and ILLYRIO join him.]</i>
VISERYS: When will they be married?
ILLYRIO: Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
VISERYS: Is it true they lie with their horses?
ILLYRIO: I wouldn’t ask Khal Drogo....
VISERYS: Do you take me for a fool?
ILLYRIO: I take you for a <i>king</i>. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I’ve given offense.
VISERYS: I know how to play a man like Drogo - I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
[DAENERYS stops walking.]</i>
DAENERYS: <i>[pleadingly]</i> I don’t <i>want</i> to be his queen.
[Both VISERYS and ILLYRIO stop walking and look back at DAENERYS.]</i>
DAENERYS: I want to go home.
VISERYS: <i>[slightly annoyed]</i> So do <i>I</i>. I want us <i>both</i> to go home. But they took it from us. So, tell me, sweet sister: how do we go home?
DAENERYS: I don’t know.
VISERYS: We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo’s army.
[He strokes her face lovingly.]</i>
VISERYS: I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that’s what it took.
[He gives DAENERYS a kiss on the forehead before walking away. DAENERYS is less than thrilled.]</i>
[Scene shifts to Winterfell, SANSA's chambers. CATELYN is braiding SANSA's hair.]</i>
SANSA: Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I’m ugly?
CATELYN: Then he is the <i>stupidest</i> prince that ever lived.
[SANSA looks at herself in a hand mirror.]</i>
SANSA: <i>[dreamily]</i> He’s so <i>handsome</i>....
[CATELYN rolls her eyes.]</i>
SANSA: When would we be married? Soon, or do we have to wait?
CATELYN: Hush, now; your father hasn’t even said yes.
SANSA: Why would he say no? He’d be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
CATELYN: He’d have to leave home. He’d have to leave <i>me</i>. And so would you.
SANSA: You left your home to come here. And I’d be queen someday.
[Brief pause. SANSA turns to face her mother.]</i>
SANSA: Please make Father say yes!
CATELYN: Sansa....
SANSA: <i>[pleading]</i> Please, please! It’s the only thing I ever wanted!
[CATELYN doesn't reply. She looks away, lost in thought.]</i>
[Scene shifts the later that night, during the banquet. Servants are bringing out food, music is playing, and all the men and women of the castle are having fun and enjoying themselves. A female servant is seen pouring ROBERT a drink. After she does this, ROBERT pulls her close to him and starts getting bawdy with her. At the high table, CATELYN and CERSEI are seen watching, with CATELYN looking slightly embarrased and CERSEI looking disgusted. ASHTER is shown flirting with several female servants and drinking himself. CATELYN is clearly not pleased when she sees this. Nearby, we see ROBB and RODRIK also watching, with RODRIK looking amused.]</i>
[Outside in the courtyard, JON is shown hitting a fencing dummy rather ferociously; he is clearly frustrated about something. At that moment, BENJEN STARK, NED's younger brother and the First Ranger of the Night's Watch, rides in. He sees JON repeatedly hitting the dummy.]</i>
BENJEN: Is he dead yet?
[JON turns around and sees BENJEN, who gets off his horse. A smile spreads across JON's face when he sees his uncle.]</i>
JON: Uncle Benjen!
[They hug.]</i>
BENJEN: You got bigger! I rode all day; didn’t want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren’t you at the feast?
[JON looks away, frustrated.]</i>
JON: Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
[BENJEN nods.]</i>
BENJEN: Well, you’re always welcome on the Wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there.
JON: So take me with you when you go back.
BENJEN: Jon -
JON: Father <i>will</i> let me if you ask him, I know he will.
[Pause as BENJEN thinks about this. JON awaits his answer.]</i>
BENJEN: The Wall isn’t going anywhere.
JON: I’m ready to swear your oath.
BENJEN: You don’t understand what you’d be giving up. We have no families, none of us will ever father sons -
[JON interrupts.]</i>
JON: I don’t <i>care</i> about that.
BENJEN: You might....if you knew what it meant.
[JON looks slightly put out. BENJEN glances back at the castle when he hears the sounds of the banquet.]</i>
BENJEN: I’d better get inside, rescue your father from his guests. We’ll talk later.
[BENJEN goes to the banquet.]</i>
TYRION: <i>[offscreen]</i> Your uncle’s in the Night’s Watch.
[JON turns around and sees TYRION finally coming back from the brothel, holding a skin of wine.]</i>
JON: What’re you doing back there?
TYRION: Preparing for a night with your family.
[He takes a swig from his skin.]</i>
TYRION: I’ve always wanted to see the Wall....
JON: You’re Tyrion Lannister. The Queen’s brother?
TYRION: My greatest accomplishment. And you – you’re Ned Stark’s bastard, aren’t you?
[JON looks insulted and turns away.]</i>
TYRION: Did I offend you? Sorry. You <i>are</i> the bastard, though.
JON: Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
TYRION: And Lady Stark is not your mother, making you the bastard.
[JON still looks insulted.]</i>
TYRION: Let me give you some advice, bastard: never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you.
[TYRION starts making his way towards the banquet.]</i>
JON: What the hell do <i>you</i> know about being a bastard?
[TYRION turns back to face JON.]</i>
TYRION: <i>All</i> dwarves are bastards in their fathers’ eyes.
[TYRION departs. JON picks up his sword and attacks the dummy with new ferocity.]</i>
[Back in the banquet. NED is off to himself when GARTH and ETHAN come up to him.]</i>
GARTH: A wolf surrounded by lions. Sounds like a gruesome battle.
[NED notices GARTH and ETHAN, and a big smile comes on his face.]</i>
NED: Garth, you old devil!
[They embrace.]</i>
GARTH: How long has it been? Sixteen? No, seventeen years?
NED: You're greying.
GARTH: Ah, well. It happens.
NED: <i>[to ETHAN]</i> Ethan, you're looking well.
ETHAN: So are you, Lord Stark.
[He shakes ETHAN's hand. There is a brief pause, followed by the three of them noticing a drunk ROBERT, still getting bawdy with the female servant.]</i>
GARTH: If there's one man who's changed, it's got to be him.
ETHAN: How did he get so fat, anyway?
NED: Well, at least the kingship isn't taking a big toll on him.
GARTH: Nor does his marriage.
[All three of them laugh.]</i>
GARTH: Ned, I have a feeling I need to warn you. Don't you think this is all a bit too suspicious? I mean, Jon dies, just like that, Robert comes to claim you as Hand...
NED: You expect Tywin Lannister has something to do with Jon's death? The man had fever, it was a surprise for all of us.
ETHAN: Yeah, but from all accounts, Lord Arryn was perfectly healthy. And then suddenly he just drops dead from a fever. It doesn't feel right to me.
NED: I understand both of your misgivings, but I think you two might be overreacting.
GARTH: Look, Tywin wants many things. If he wanted the Iron Throne, he could've taken it back when he sacked King's Landing. He could've beheaded Robert and planted his golden arse on the damn thing. But he didn't. Never trust a Lannister...
[NED interrupts GARTH.]</i>
NED: I trust Robert.
ETHAN: Yeah, but he also happens to have Tywin's daughter for a wife and his son as one of the Kingsguard. If the Lannisters decide they want the Iron Throne, it wouldn't exactly be hard for them to get it. And remember...Jaime Lannister's already stabbed one king in the back. Who's to say he wouldn't do it again?
[Brief pause as NED considers this. He decides to change the subject.]</i>
NED: How's Lucius?
GARTH: Not well. He's quiet. Too quiet.
[The three of them spot LUCIUS in the crowd, drinking wine by himself at one of the tables.]</i>
GARTH: I don't trust him.
NED: Keep a closer eye on him if you can.
[ETHAN looks around.]</i>
ETHAN: If you two don't mind, I'll go ahead and rejoin the festivities.
[GARTH nods, and NED claps him on the shoulder. As ETHAN is leaving, RUTHERFORD QUINN, the Lord of Widow's Watch approaches NED and GARTH.]</i>
RUTHERFORD: Ned!
NED: Rutherford? Gods... I haven't seen you since the Greyjoy Rebellion.
[They embrace.]</i>
GARTH: Lord Quinn! It's good to see you.
[GARTH and RUTHERFORD shake hands.]</i>
RUTHERFORD: You too, Garth. You're looking pretty good, if you don't mind me saying.
GARTH: You are too, for a man your age.
[RUTHERFORD chuckles to himself.]</i>
RUTHERFORD: You both remember my injury, don't you?
NED: Ah. Yes. What was it, again?
RUTHERFORD: My leg is shit. I wasn't able to walk for five years. Well, walk properly. I'm alright now.
GARTH: How'd it happen again? Lance diagonally through your leg, right?
[RUTHERFORD winces as he remembers how the injury happened.]</i>
RUTHERFORD: Yeah. It happened on Old Wyk, I believe. But like I said, it's much better than it used to be.
NED: Good to hear it. What brings you to Winterfell?
[RUTHERFORD shrugs.]</i>
RUTHERFORD: I suppose it was time that I finally visit an old friend. But I actually get to see <i>two</i> old friends.
GARTH: King Robert needed someone to help guide his party into the North; it'd been a long time since he'd been up here, so me, my son, and my half-brother Ethan all volunteered.
RUTHERFORD: Good to hear. <i>[to NED]</i> How's your sons doing? Your daughters?
NED: They're doing well. Maybe you should ask them yourselves.
[NED smirks.]</i>
RUTHERFORD: Maybe I will.
[The two look over at HAROLD QUINN, RUTHERFORD's son, who is enjoying the festivities.]</i>
RUTHERFORD: He's a man of forty. And he's my heir. I'm a man of seventy-seven. I'm old. I have had my time. I've been thinking of... passing my lordship to my son. I'm not fit to rule anymore, Ned. I need to fight.
NED: If there's a war to be fought, you both will be the first I call.
[GARTH grins to himself.]</i>
RUTHERFORD: Good. Very good.
[RUTHERFORD departs to rejoin the festivities. BENJEN is seen entering the hall and goes over to NED and GARTH.]</i>
BENJEN: Lord Dragen.
GARTH: Benjen.
[GARTH claps NED on the shoulder and leaves.]</i>
BENJEN: You at a feast—It’s like a bear in a trap.
NED: The boy I beheaded....did you know him?
BENJEN: Of course I did. Just a lad. And he was tough, Ned. A true ranger.
[NED looks away.]</i>
NED: He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.
BENJEN: The two he was with are still missing.
NED: Hmm....a wildling ambush....
BENJEN: Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall, talk of the Walkers, and my brother might be the next Hand of the King. Winter <i>is</i> coming.
NED: Winter is coming.
[ROBB walks up to both of them.]</i>
ROBB: Uncle Benjen.
BENJEN: Robb boy. How are you?
ROBB: I’m good.
[They embrace. We see ASHTER is making out with a woman - the same woman he was with in the godswood - and he puts his hand inside her dress, and the girl seems to be pleased. It is clear that he is slightly intoxicated from the wine. ROBB, NED, and BENJEN all see this. NED looks exasperated. ROBB leaves them and heads off towards ASHTER.]</i>
ASHTER: <i>[to the woman]</i> I'll be back. Don't you go anywhere.
[The woman smiles at him warmly. He gets up to get more wine but is stopped by ROBB. We see RODRIK watching from another table, looking amused.]</i>
ROBB: You know both Mother and Father don't approve.
[ASHTER rolls his eyes.]</i>
ASHTER: Tell me something I don't know, Robb...
[He resumes trying to get wine, but ROBB continues to stop him.]</i>
ROBB: Do you even <i>know</i> who that woman is?
ASHTER: Well, we've gotten pretty well acquainted, as you saw earlier in the godswood.
[ROBB sighs, exasperated.]</i>
ROBB: Ashter, do you know her name?
ASHTER: <i>[slightly annoyed]</i> Does it matter? Do <i>you</i> remember the name of <i>your</i> first?
ROBB: Eleyna.
ASHTER: No, she was mine.
ROBB: <i>[confused]</i> Wait, what?!
[ASHTER laughs.]</i>
ASHTER: I'm kidding. Now, can you please step aside? I could use some more wine.
ROBB: Did you meet Uncle Benjen?
ASHTER: <i>[surprised]</i> Uncle Benjen? He's here?
ROBB: Yeah, he's with Father.
[ROBB nods over to NED and BENJEN. ASHTER spots them and grins. BENJEN sees ASHTER and grins back.]</i>
ASHTER: Well, that's certainly a surprise.
ROBB: You should go say hello. I bet he'd love to see you.
ASHTER: Oh, I will. But later.
[ASHTER suddenly looks around.]</i>
ASHTER: Where's Jon? He should be in here enjoying himself with the rest of us.
[ROBB suddenly looks uncomfortable and looks away.]</i>
ROBB: He's outside. Mother though having a bastard in here would be an insult to the royal family.
[ASHTER suddenly looks irked as he glances outside.]</i>
ASHTER: Seven fucking hells.....
[He storms off. ROBB goes back to his table and sits with RODRIK. RODRIK's gaze is lingering on the woman ASHTER was with.]</i>
RODRIK: You gotta admit, Robb, Ash has got balls getting away with all that right in front of Mother and Father.
[ROBB shrugs sheepishly, conceding that RODRIK has a point. Elsewhere in the hall, we see KING ROBERT still getting bawdy with the wench. CATELYN and CERSEI are still watching, both looking embarrassed. CERSEI's cousin, ROBERT, is pouring wine for both of them.]</i>
CATELYN: <i>[trying to break the ice]</i> Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?
CERSEI: Yes. Lovely country.
[They both glance at SANSA, who is sitting with several friends and gossiping. She glances up at the high table and makes eye contact with CERSEI.]</i>
CATELYN: I’m sure it’s very grim, after King's Landing.
[SANSA gets up and leaves her table.]</i>
CATELYN: I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.
[ROBERT has filled CERSEI's glass and starts to fill CATELYN's glass. He accidentally spills some wine.]</i>
ROBERT LANNISTER: <i>[embarrased]</i> Ah...my apologies, Lady Stark.
CATELYN: Don't worry about it. I...didn't catch your name.
ROBERT LANNISTER: Robert, m'lady. Robert Lannister.
CERSEI: He's my cousin, and previously served as my father's squire.
ROBERT LANNISTER: Lord Tywin assigned me to attend to his children while they are living in King's Landing.
CATELYN: I'm sure you've served them well.
[Brief pause.]</i>
CERSEI: I think both Lady Stark and I have enough wine now, cousin. Perhaps you should go see if Jaime needs your help with anything.
[ROBERT nods and quickly departs. SANSA walks up to the high table and stands before CERSEI and her mother, smiling shyly at CERSEI.]</i>
CERSEI: Hello, Little Dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?
SANSA: Thirteen, Your Grace.
CERSEI: You’re tall. Still growing?
SANSA: I think so, Your Grace.
CERSEI: And have you bled yet?
[SANSA is clearly a little uncomfortable at this question. She briefly makes eye contact with her mother, who is also a bit uncomfortable with it, before looking back at CERSEI, shaking her head.]</i>
SANSA:...No, Your Grace.
[Brief awkward pause.]</i>
CERSEI: And your dress. Did you make it?
[SANSA nods yes, her smile returning.]</i>
CERSEI: Such talent. You must make something for me.
[SANSA nods and departs.]</i>
CERSEI: I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
CATELYN: I hear the same.
CERSEI: Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn’t stay hidden up here forever.
[CATELYN glances at her with an unsure look. SANSA has returned to her table to sit with her friends. She glances over to where JOFFREY is sitting. They catch each others' eyes and JOFFREY gives her a smile. SANSA looks impressed with herself and turns to talk to her friend again. RODRIK glances at JOFFREY with comtempt from his and ROBB's table.]</i>
RODRIK: Have you seen the prince, Robb? Ever since he got here, that spoiled little shit has been bossing everyone around like he owns the place.
ROBB: Well, he technically does....
RODRIK: No. His <i>father</i> technically does....
[They both laugh.]</i>
RODRIK: If you ask me, he should be smacked around the ears more often.
ROBB: Don't let Sansa hear you say that. You know how fond she is of the prince.
[RODRIK rolls his eyes.]</i> 
[Elsewhere in the hall, NED runs into JAIME.]</i>
NED: Your pardon....
[NED tries to get by, but JAIME blocks him.]</i>
JAIME: I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it’s true.
NED: Yes, the King has honored me with his offer.
JAIME: <i>[pompously]</i> I’m sure we’ll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale.
NED: I don’t fight in tournaments.
JAIME: No? Getting a little old for it?
NED: I don’t fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don’t want him to know what I can do.
JAIME: <i>[sarcastic]</i> Well said.
[Elsewhere in the hall, ARYA flips food at SANSA from another table.]</i>
SANSA: <i>[embarrassed]</i> Arya?!
[ARYA is preparing to do it again. SANSA's friend cleans the food off her face. Someone is heard laughing from another table.]</i>
SANSA: It's not funny!
[CATELYN scans the room from the high table and sees both ROBB and RODRIK laughing from their table. She makes eye contact with ROBB and signals him to take ARYA to bed. ROBB does so.]</i>
ROBB: Time for bed.
[ROBB takes ARYA away from the feast. ASHTER, still holding the mug of wine, sees this and glances up at his mother and CERSEI at the high table, a frown on his face. He goes up to the table.]</i>
ASHTER: Your Grace.
[He nods politely to her.]</i>
CERSEI: And your name?
ASHTER: Ashter.
CERSEI: Ah, so you're the one I've heard so many stories about. I hear you've earned quite the reputation in the last few years. I've heard many people talk about you back in King's Landing.
ASHTER: <i>[surprised]</i> Really?
[CERSEI smirks.]</i>
CERSEI: Oh, yes. They say you're an aspiring battle commander. Tell me, Ashter Stark, do you think of yourself as that?
[ASHTER shrugs.]</i>
ASHTER: I believe so, Your Grace. Although, I've been told to be more humble.
[CERSEI nods.]</i>
CERSEI: And have you followed through on that?
[ASHTER chuckles to himself.]</i>
ASHTER: I suppose it's a matter of perspective.
CERSEI: You're very young to have received such a reputation. It's very impressive.
[ASHTER grins sheepishly. CATELYN is seen grinning too.]</i>
ASHTER: Thank you, Your Grace.
CERSEI: Now, I know you didn't come to speak with me. What is it you were going to ask your mother?
[ASHTER looks at his mother, suddenly seeming agitated.]</i>
ASHTER: Mother, why is Jon outside?
[CATELYN's grin vanishes. She now seems agitated herself.]</i>
CATELYN: You are completely aware of why.
[ASHTER now seems insulted.]</i>
ASHTER: Mother, It's insulting. Whether you like it or not, Jon's a part of our family, and he deserves to sit with us!
[CATELYN's face has stiffened. She is clearly getting angry herself. CERSEI seems to be mildly entertained by this argument. ASHTER notices this and composes himself.]</i>
ASHTER: I apologize, Your Grace. I'm talking about my half-brother Jon Snow...
CERSEI: Ah, yes. I've heard stories about the bastard as well.
CATELYN: Jon will stay where he is.
[ASHTER's anger has returned. He forcefully throws his mug of wine on the ground.]</i>
ASHTER: I do <i>not</i> accept that.
CATELYN: Excuse me?
[CERSEI quietly laughs to herself.]</i>
ASHTER: <i>[hotly]</i> You can hate him all you want, but it's <i>not</i> his fault; you <i>know</i> it isn't! This is just unfair and needlessly cruel.
[CATELYN stands. She has a resentful look on her face.]</i>
CATELYN: <i>[coldly]</i> I will not discuss this matter any further.
ASHTER: You...!
CERSEI: <i>[snidely]</i> I think it would be best to listen to your mother. And...perhaps lay off the wine for the rest of the night.
[She smirks maliciously and glances at ASHTER's mug on the ground. ASHTER glances at it too and suddenly looks embarrassed, closing his eyes in exasperation.]</i>
ASHTER: <i>[not looking at either of them]</i> Right. My apologies, Your Grace.
[He gives his mother one last resentful look before leaving. CATELYN finally sits down, exchanges one last look with CERSEI before sighing in exasperation.]</i>
[Back in the courtyard, JON is still hitting the training dummy, but is clearly tired. After a while, he sits down on a nearby bench, closing his eyes in exasperation. ASHTER is shown leaving the main hall, still looking angry, two mugs of wine in hand, and immediately heads over to JON, who immediately looks up when he sees ASHTER coming.]</i>
ASHTER: You alright?
JON: <i>[not looking at him]</i> I suppose so.
[This is clearly a lie. ASHTER goes over to sit by JON and offers him one of the mugs of wine.]</i>
ASHTER: I was able to sneak this out of the feast. Here - take it.
JON: Thanks, but I'm not thirsty.
ASHTER: Come on. If anyone needs some wine right now, it's you.
[JON glances at the wine, which ASHTER is still offering him. JON takes it and takes a long swig from it. ASHTER takes a swig from his own mug.]</i>
ASHTER: I tried to convince Mother to bring you in - I would have done it sooner if I knew earlier.
[JON looks away, looking resentful.]</i>
JON: You were wasting your time, Ashter. You know how your mother feels about me.
[He takes another drink. ASHTER still looks frustrated.]</i>
ASHTER: I tried to tell her that none of this is your fault, but she just doesn't listen.
JON: <i>[still looking away]</i> No, she was right to do it. I didn't want to insult the royal family.
ASHTER: Really? You're really gonna say that?
[ASHTER stands. As he does, JON looks at him.]</i>
ASHTER: You don't believe that. I <i>know</i> you don't. You're my brother. You can get called a bastard every day, but you're a Stark. You always have been and you always will be. Mother can tell you that you aren't all she wants, but she's wrong. You're a Stark, and you're my brother.
[JON smiles, and stands up.]</i>
JON: Thanks, Ashter. I needed that.
[ASHTER smiles.]</i>
ASHTER: You look exhausted. Get out of this cold and get some sleep.
[JON nods, and both of them return to the castle together.]</i>
[Scene shifts to later that night, after the banquet. NED and CATELYN are in their chambers in bed together.]</i>
NED: I’m a Northman. I belong here with you, not down South in that rat’s nest they call a capital.
CATELYN: I <i>won’t</i> let him take you.
NED: The King takes what he wants. That’s why he’s king.
[CATELYN smirks and looks up at NED.]</i>
CATELYN: I’ll say, "Listen, fat man...."
[NED chuckles.]</i>
CATELYN: "....you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now."
NED: How did he get so <i>fat</i>?
CATELYN: <i>[jokingly]</i> He only stops eating when it’s time for a drink.
[They both chuckle. There's a knock on their door.]</i>
SERVANT: It’s Maester Luwin, my lord.
NED: Send him in.
[LUWIN enters.]</i>
LUWIN: Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night. <i>[to CATELYN]</i> From your sister.
[CATELYN looks up, surprised. She gets out of the bed, and LUWIN hands her a sealed letter. LUWIN starts to leave.]</i>
NED: <i>[to LUWIN]</i> Stay.
[LUWIN does so.]</i>
CATELYN: This was sent from the Eyrie....
[She opens the letter and starts reading through it.]</i>
CATELYN: What’s she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn’t been back there since her wedding....
[She reads the note, looks up in alarm, and then throws it into the nearby fireplace. NED gets out of bed and joins her.]</i>
NED: What news?
CATELYN: She’s fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the King is in danger.
[NED looks shocked.]</i>
NED: She’s fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn’t know what she’s saying.
CATELYN: Lysa’s head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life - her <i>son’s</i> life - if she wasn’t certain her husband was murdered?
[NED looks quite shaken from this news. He wanders away, lost in thought.]</i>
NED: This is exactly what Garth said....
LUWIN: If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?
CATELYN: They murdered the last Hand! Now you want Ned to take the job?
LUWIN: The King rode for a month to ask Lord Stark’s help. He’s the only one he trusts. <i>[to NED]</i> You swore the king an oath, my lord.
CATELYN: He spent half his life fighting Robert’s wars. He owes him nothing. <i>[to NED]</i> Your father and brother rode south once on a king’s demand.
LUWIN: A different time. A different king.
[NED still has his back both to them, looking grave and lost in thought.]</i>
[Scene shifts back to across the Narrow Sea, during DAENERYS and DROGO's wedding celebration. Music is playing and the guests, Dothraki and Pentoshi alike, are all dancing and enjoying themselves. DROGO and DAENERYS are seated in a place of honor, with VISERYS, ILLYRIO, and DROGO's bloodriders all sitting with them. A guest approaches them and presents his gift to them, bowing before both of them as he does. One of DROGO's bloodriders, QOTHO, takes the gift and puts it with the others. Other guests bring other gifts. DROGO observes the celebration emotionlessly, but DAENERYS is clearly uncomfortable with the whole atmosphere. VISERYS observes the celebration as well, looking like he doesn't really want to be there.]</i>
VISERYS: <i>[impatient, to ILLYRIO]</i> When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.
ILLYRIO: If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it.
VISERYS: When?
ILLYRIO: When their omens favor war.
VISERYS: <i>[annoyed]</i> I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.
[Elsewhere in the celebration, a Dothraki male is having sex with a female out in the open. Another Dothraki male sees this and shoves the first one out of the way, then begins having sex with the female as well. DROGO smirks when he sees this, but DAENERYS looks uncomfortable when she sees it. The first then pull the second away from the woman, and the two being fighting. A crowd gathers around them and cheers them on as they fight. They both eventually pull out bladed weapons to fight with, with the first one eventually killing the second by slicing his abdomen open. DROGO looks pleased when he sees this, but both DAENERYS and VISERYS both look shocked. ILLYRIO is clapping.]</i>
ILLYRIO: <i>[to VISERYS]</i> A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.
[VISERYS looks amused. The winner of the fight now has several women with him. DAENERYS still looks uncomfortable, even more so when she sees DROGO's pleased reaction. A Westerosi knight is seen approaching them holding a small stack of books. He is SER JORAH MORMONT, an exiled knight from the North.]</i>
DROGO: <i>[in Dothraki]</i> Come, Jorah the Andal.
[JORAH greets him back in Dothraki. He approaches DROGO and DAENERYS.]</i>
JORAH: A small gift for the new Khaleesi - songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.
[He hands DAENERYS the stack of books.]</i>
DAENERYS: Thank you, Ser. Are you from my country?
JORAH: Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. <i>[to VISERYS]</i> Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king.
VISERYS: I won't forget that once I claim the throne, Ser Jorah.
[JORAH smiles at him.]</i>
JORAH: The Mormonts have faithfully served the Targaryens for generations, Your Grace. My grandfather, Jasper Mormont, was even a member of your grandfather Aegon's Kingsguard.
VISERYS: That he was. Wasn't Jasper Mormont also know as "the Great Bear"?.
JORAH: Aye, he was.
DAENERYS: He sounds like he was an interesting man.
[JORAH steps aside. ILLYRIO waves a pair of servants carrying a large chest towards them. They open the chest, revealing its' contents to be three petrified dragon eggs. DAENERYS is clearly in awe of the eggs and takes one of them out to look at it.]</i>
ILLYRIO: Dragons’ eggs, Daenerys, from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful.
DAENERYS: Thank you, Magister.
[DAENERYS continues to look at the egg for a bit before setting it back in the chest. DROGO stands up and starts making his way back through the crowd. DAENERYS stands and timidly follows suit. All the other khalasar members stand to get a good look at her as she makes her way through the crowd. She finally reaches DROGO, who is standing next to a beautiful white horse - his wedding present to her. JORAH is shown following her. She is seen gently stroking the horse's mane.]</i>
DAENERYS: She's beautiful.
[DROGO looks on emotionlessly. DAENERYS glances over at JORAH.]</i>
DAENERYS: Ser Jorah, I...I don’t know how to say ‘thank you’ in Dothraki.
JORAH: There is no word for ‘thank you’ in Dothraki.
[DROGO goes over to pick DAENERYS up and puts her on the horse. He then goes over to his horse, which is right next to hers, and mounts it. VISERYS wanders over and grabs part of her dress.]</i>
VISERYS: <i>[without looking at her]</i> Make him happy.
[DAENERYS looks down at him, looking unsure. DROGO rides off, with DAENERYS following suit. VISERYS watches them both go, a grin on his face.]</i>
[Scene shifts to a beachhead by the sea. It is sunset. DAENERYS is at the very edge and is staring off into the distance. DROGO wanders over to her and starts to remove her dress. As he does this, DAENERYS begins sobbing. When he sees this, DROGO wipes the tears away.]</i>
DROGO: No.
DAENERYS: Do you know the Common Tongue?
[Brief pause as he continues to remove her dress.]</i>
DROGO: <i>[without looking at her]</i> No.
DAENERYS: Is ‘no’ the only word that you know?
DROGO: No.
[He finally removes her dress completely, leaving her naked. DAENERYS resumes crying and covers her breasts, but DROGO pulls her arms away. He then proceeds to bend her over.]</i>
[The scene shifts to Winterfell. NED is seen entering Winterfell's Sept where ARCHSEPTON REDMOND is seen reading a book. He looks up and sees NED approaching.]</i>
REDMOND: Lord Stark!
NED: Archsepton.
REDMOND: I hear you've accepted King Robert's invitation to become his new Hand.
NED: You've heard correctly.
[NED sits down, a worried look on his face.]</i>
REDMOND: You look troubled.
NED: I wonder if I'm doing the right thing. Leaving Winterfell. Leaving Cat.
REDMOND: Your wife mentioned to me the letter her sister sent her last night. If what Lady Arryn says is true and King Robert's life really is in danger, only you can protect him from suffering the same fate Jon Arryn did.
NED: That's what Maester Luwin said.
[Pause while NED thinks of what to say next.]</i>
NED: Lysa also said in that letter that the Lannisters were responsible for Jon's death. Lord Dragen also seems to think they're manipulating Robert.
REDMOND: Manipulating him?
[He laughs.]</i>
REDMOND: King Robert may be a drunkard, but I'd like to think he's sharp enough not to be manipulated by anyone.
NED: And now he wants me to follow him to that den of vipers King's Landing where I'll be surrounded by them. I'd be putting my family at risk.
REDMOND: But if you don't, and if whoever killed Lord Arryn - whether it was the Lannisters or it wasn't - kills King Robert too - that would mean chaos for the Seven Kingdoms.
[Another pause. NED looks away, uneasy.]</i>
REDMOND: You've done what you think is right. And I've never known your sense of judgment to be wrong, Lord Stark. Do you think becoming the new Hand of the King was the right thing to do for you?
[Pause while NED thinks.]</i>
NED: Yes.
REDMOND: Then go. Go to King's Landing and do your duty. And the blessings of the Gods - both the old and the new - will go with you.
[NED smiles]</i>
NED: Thank you, Archsepton.
[REDMOND smiles in a good-natured way as NED leaves the Sept.]</i>
[Shift to the stables, where TYRION is sitting with THE HOUND. THE HOUND is pulling on his boots. TYRION appears to be slightly hungover.]</i>
THE HOUND: Rough night, Imp?
TYRION: If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle.
THE HOUND: I didn’t pick you for a hunter.
TYRION: The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.
THE HOUND: It’s not hunting if you pay for it....
[We see THEON coming in from another area to hand NED, who is sitting on his horse, his gloves. ROBERT, who is also on his horse, also rides in from nearby.]</i>
ROBERT: Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?
NED: No. But I’m still better than you.
[ROBERT chuckles.]</i>
ROBERT: I know what I’m putting you through. Thank you for saying yes.
[NED glances up at ROBERT, looking a bit unsure.]</i>
ROBERT: I only ask you because I need you. You’re a loyal friend. You hear me? A <i>loyal</i> friend - the last one I’ve got.
NED: I hope I’ll serve you well.
ROBERT: You will. And I’ll make sure you don’t look so fucking grim all the time.
[NED grins.]</i>
ROBERT: Come on, boys, let’s go kill some boar!
[They ride off. Nearby, we see ROBB preparing his horse to join them. LUCIUS DRAGEN wanders over to him, a smirk on his face.]</i>
LUCIUS: Robb! Good morning.
[ROBB glances at LUCIUS dismissively.]</i>
ROBB: Lucius...
LUCIUS: Had a good night?
[ROBB shrugs.]</i>
ROBB: Can't complain.
[LUCIUS glances at ROBB's direwolf, GREY WIND, who is standing by ROBB's feet and has noticebly gotten bigger since he first got it.]</i>
LUCIUS: Your wolves are certainly getting bigger. I always expect that one of them will try to attack me.
[ROBB gives a nervous laugh.]</i>
ROBB: Grey Wind won't attack anyone until I say that he can.
LUCIUS: Grey Wind...startling name.
[Brief pause.]</i>
LUCIUS: I hope for your sake, you're right. Usually anything that originally comes from beyond the Wall can't be tamed.
[LUCIUS turns around to see the king's party readying themselves for departure.]</i>
LUCIUS: King's Landing. The City of Serpents. A lone wolf surrounded by a band of lions. That never ends well, don't you think?
ROBB: My father is strong enough to handle himself in King's Landing. Even around the Lannisters.
LUCIUS: Are you sure about that?
[Another brief pause. ROBB glances at LUCIUS with a mixture of concern and confusion.]</i>
ROBB: Are you trying to get at me, Lucius?
[LUCIUS gives a snort of laughter.]</i>
LUCIUS: I'm just saying - the capital can be poison to he who is uninitiated. But, as your mother once told you, and my mother certainly told me, it is important, always, to try new things.
ROBB: What in Seven Hells in that supposed to mean?
LUCIUS: It means -
ASHTER: <i>[offscreen]</i> Oi, Snake!
[Both ASHTER and RODRIK enter, ASHTER looking a bit annoyed. LUCIUS glances at him, a bit confused.]</i>
ASHTER: Leave Robb alone, will you?
[LUCIUS chuckles.]</i>
LUCIUS: Oh, calm down, Ashter. We were just having some friendly morning conversation.
[ASHTER looks skeptical.]</i>
LUCIUS: But if you insist....
[He leaves. ASHTER stares after him, a suspicious look on his face.]</i>
ASHTER: That Dragen. I don't like him.
ROBB: Really, Ashter, that seemed unnecessary. We really were just talking.
ASHTER: You've heard those nasty rumors about him, have you?
[ROBB looks away, uncomfortable.]</i>
ROBB: Yeah. I don't believe them, though.
[Pause.]</i>
RODRIK: Did you hear, Robb? Father's taking me with him to King's Landing to squire for Barristan Selmy!
[ROBB smiles.]</i>
ROBB: Yes, Father told me earlier. Looks like you'll be a knight sooner than we all thought!
[RODRIK grins.]</i>
RODRIK: I hope so!
[ASHTER claps RODRIK on the shoulder.]</i>
ASHTER: Maybe you and Bran will be in the Kingsguard together one day!
[RODRIK laughs. ROBB rides off to join his father and the king. ASHTER and RODRIK watch him leave, then start to head back towards the castle. BRAN is seen watching ROBB leave from afar, with SUMMER sniffing around by his feet.]</i>
BRAN: <i>[to SUMMER]</i> Come on, you.
[They both walk off. We next see BRAN climbing up another tower. SUMMER is waiting for him on the ground. As BRAN climbs farther up the tower, he hears some kind of moaning. He appears confused. He slowly makes his way to the tower's window, where he spots JAIME and CERSEI having sex with each other. After a few minutes, CERSEI looks up and sees BRAN watching her and JAIME. BRAN looks gets a "deer in the headlights" look.]</i>
CERSEI: <i>[to JAIME]</i> Stop. STOP!
[JAIME immediately rushes over and grabs BRAN.]</i>
JAIME: Are you completely mad?!
CERSEI: He saw us!
JAIME: It’s all right. It’s all right....
CERSEI: <i>[urgently]</i> He <i>saw</i> us!
JAIME: <i>[to CERSEI]</i> I heard you the first time.
[JAIME glances out the window, spotting SUMMER down on the ground.]</i>
JAIME: <i>[to BRAN]</i> Quite the little climber, aren’t you? How old are you, boy?
BRAN: Ten.
JAIME: Ten....
[JAIME lets go of BRAN, who steadies himself on the window, and looks at CERSEI, who gazes back imploringly. There is a long pause as they stare at each other.]</i>
JAIME: The things I do for love.
[He promptly shoves BRAN out the window.]</i>
/ BLACKOUT /
