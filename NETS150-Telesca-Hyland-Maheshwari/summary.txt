Game of Thrones IR

Description:

We decided to do IR on Game of Thrones episode transcripts which were compiled using web scraping techniques taught in class. The files "ScriptGetter.java" and "ScriptTester.java" in the JavaCode folder implement this, and the EpisodeTranscripts folder contains the output. For the information retrieval, we implemented the boolean model to query episodes and see character overlap; you would be surprised how few character make it to the last season! This code is contained in the "BooleanMatrix.java" file in the JavaCode folder which we used to answer some of our analysis questions. In addition to this, we modified the code from HW4 to output the cosine similarity values of each of the transcripts in a csv file. This file was then uploaded to MATLAB and we wrote a script to visualize this data. This data, as well as an analysis writeup with a screenshot is contained within the nets150visual folder. Our analysis questions are contianed in the "analysis.txt" file contained in the main folder.

During our work process, we faced some issues. Firstly, we found a website with the scripts for every episode, but when we attempted to web scrape from it we got an Error 403. It turns out that the website forbade web scraping. We had to find another page to scrape from which only had about half of the episodes, so our data does not encompass the whole series. Additionally, we had no way of differentiating between main characters and smaller characters and extras. We collected data for 405 total characters but many of them only appear once or twice, so our percentages of characters in multiple episodes, for example, is smaller than it would be if just looking at main characters.
