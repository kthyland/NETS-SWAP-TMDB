Game of Thrones IR

Description:

We decided to do IR on Game of Thrones episode transcripts which were compiled using web scraping techniques taught in class. The files "ScriptGetter.java" and "ScriptTester.java" in the JavaCode folder implement this, and the EpisodeTranscripts folder contains the output. For the information retrieval, we implemented the boolean model to query episodes and see character overlap; you would be surprised how few character make it to the last season! This code is contained in the "BooleanMatrix.java" file in the JavaCode folder and screenshots of sample queries are provided in the folder as well. In addition to this, we modified the code from HW4 to output the cosine similarity values of each of the transcripts in a csv file. This file was then uploaded to MATLAB and we wrote a script to visualize this data. This data, as well as an analysis writeup with a screenshot is contained within the nets150visual folder. Our analysis questions are contianed in the "analysis.txt" file contained in the main folder.
